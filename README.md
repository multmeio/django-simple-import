====================

An import tool easy enough your users could use it. django-simple-import aims to keep track of logs 
and user preferences in the database. 

Project is not yet stable, do not use in production.

## Features

- Set related objects by any unique field (not implimented)
- Simulate imports before commiting to database

## Install


## Usage
First, update your settings file, adding the app name in `INSTALLED_APPS`

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'simple_import',
        ...
    ]
    
    
Seconds, syncronize your database and install all migrations

    ./manage.py syncb
    ./manage.py migrate simple_import

### Security
I'm working on the assumtion you staff users are trusted. Only users with change permission 
to a field will see it as an option. But I have not spent much time looking for ways users could
manipulate urls to run unauthorized imports. Feel free to contribute if this is a need you have.
All import views do require admin "is staff" permission.
