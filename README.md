## Install

1. pip install django-simple-import
1. Add 'simple_import' to INSTALLED APPS
1. Add simple_import to urls.py like
urlpatterns += url(r'^simple_import/', include('simple_import.urls')),
1. syncdb (you may use south)

## Usage

Go to /simple_import/start_import/ or use the admin interface

In the screenshots I gave them a django-grappelli theme. The base templates have no style and are very basic.
See example of customization [here](https://github.com/burke-software/django-sis/tree/master/templates/simple_import)

### Security
I'm working on the assumtion staff users are trusted. Only users with change permission
to a field will see it as an option. But I have not spent much time looking for ways users could
manipulate urls to run unauthorized imports. Feel free to contribute if this is a need you have.
All import views do require admin "is staff" permission.
